# Rock Paper Scissor game in C

A basic Rock Paper Scissors game in C where the user plays against the computer. It uses random choices for the computer and keeps track of wins, losses, and draws until the user quits.



## 📄Description:

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game developed in C, where the user competes against the computer. The computer makes random choices between Rock, Paper, and Scissors each round. The program determines the winner based on classic game rules and keeps track of wins, losses, and draws. The game runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit. This project demonstrates fundamental C programming concepts such as input/output handling, random number generation, and control flow.
## 💡 Key Concepts Used:

(i) Basic Input and Output (scanf, printf)

(ii) Conditional Statements (if, else if, else)

(iii) Looping (while loop) for continuous gameplay

(iv) Functions to organize code (getComputerChoice(), determineWinner())

(v) Random Number Generation using rand() and srand()

(vi) Arrays of strings for mapping choices to names

(vii) Simple score tracking and counters

(viii) Use of time(NULL) to seed randomness


## ✨ Features:

* Simple command-line interface for easy gameplay

* User vs Computer mode with random computer choices

* Input validation to handle invalid entries

* Real-time tracking of wins, losses, and draws

* Score counter showing overall game progress

* Option to play multiple rounds until user quits

* Proper use of random number generation for fair results
## 🔔 Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to create a simple interactive Rock Paper Scissors game in C that allows the user to play against the computer. It demonstrates basic programming concepts such as user input handling, random number generation, conditional logic, and loop control. This project helps beginners practice fundamental C programming skills while building a fun and engaging game.
## 🧠 Concepts Practiced:

=> Basic input and output in C (printf, scanf)

=> Using conditional statements (if, else if, else)

=> Generating random numbers with rand() and srand()

=> Implementing game logic and decision making

=> Using loops to repeat actions

=> Managing variables for score tracking

=> Functions for code modularity and clarity

## 📚 What I Learned from This Project:

-> How to build an interactive command-line game using C programming.

-> The use of rand() and srand() functions to generate random choices for the computer.

-> Implementing game logic using conditional statements like if-else.

-> Using loops to keep the game running until the user decides to exit.

-> Taking and validating user input efficiently.

-> Tracking and displaying the score after each round of the game.

-> Gained confidence in structuring simple games and applying core C concepts in a fun way.
